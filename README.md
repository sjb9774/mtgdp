Implements a script, `get_pricing.py`, for pulling pricing from various distinct MTG pricing providers and writes the data in a consistent format to JSON with the ability to support custom writers that write to a DB, CSV, etc. Additionally, a small web app is provided that generates a visualization (using d3.js) for a given product.
